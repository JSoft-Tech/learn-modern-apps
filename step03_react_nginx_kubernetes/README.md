Install Minikube:

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/

Tag the image to get it ready to push to docker hub

docker tag my_react_nginx ziaukhan/nginx-react:step03

docker push ziaukhan/nginx-react:step03

Now it is available at https://hub.docker.com/r/ziaukhan/nginx-react/tags/

Now start minikube:

minikube start

Check to see if the cluster is up and running:

kubectl cluster-info

Check to see one node is running:

kubectl get nodes

Get full info about the node:

kubectl describe node minikube

To create the deployment:

kubectl create -f deployment.yaml --record

To see the status of the deployment:

kubectl rollout status deployment nginx-react-deployment

To check and see if ReplicaSet was created sucessfully:

kubectl get rs

To check and see if the three pods are up and running (it will take a few moments):

kubectl get pods

To see the labels on the pods:

kubectl get po --show-labels

Now create a loadbalancer service so that we can access from outside the cluster:

kubectl create -f service.yaml

To get the external IP address:

kubectl get svc nginx-react-loadbalancer

As we are using Minikube, even though the load balancer will never be
provisioned, you can still access the service through the node port (at the
Minikube VMâ€™s IP address)

To get the IP address of the Minikube:

minikube ip

Now your home work is to connect to the loadbalancer service locally thorough your browser.
